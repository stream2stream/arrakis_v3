The front end would not work correctly after forking the repo. We had to make a seperate repo for the front end to work.

The link to the github repository is: https://github.com/lisadesai/arrakis_v3

Our backend files are also on the repo, but only Lisa submitted to the repo. All submits and branches on this repo are submitted for the backend by Danche and Ashley
